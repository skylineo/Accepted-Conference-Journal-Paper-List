|A deep learning framework for modelling left-turning vehicle behaviour considering diagonal-crossing motorcycle conflicts at mixed-flow intersections|To model vehicle turning behaviour, we present a novel interaction-aware deep-learning framework. Firstly, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based network is employed to encode vehicle historical motion features. Then, each vehicle’s potential target lanes are identified with a probabilistic method, followed by a pooling module that extracts and summarizes intention features. Thirdly, Graph Attention Network (GAT) and a synthesized network are introduced to model vehicle-vehicle interaction and vehicle-motorcycle interaction respectively. Finally, multiple kinds of obtained features are sent to a LSTM based decoder module to generate future displacement and body orientation.|partc 2021|
|A Bayesian inference based adaptive lane change prediction model|This paper aims to build a lane change prediction model for surrounding vehiclesl to adapt to the change of road and traffic environment based on machine learning methods. The lane change prediction model contains a basic model and an adaptive model: the basic model is a long short-term memory (LSTM) based prediction model which reflects the decision-making mode for drivers; the adaptive prediction model embeds an adaptive decision threshold on the basic model, and the threshold updates by Bayesian Inference method on time.|partc 2021|
|Predicting time-varying, speed-varying dilemma zones using machine learning and continuous vehicle tracking| This paper proposes an innovative framework of predicting driver behavior under varying dilemma zone conditions.A linear SVM was used to extract through vehicles from all approaching vehicles detected from radar sensors. A hierarchical clustering method was utilized to classify different traffic patterns by time-of-day. Finally, driver behavior prediction models were developed using three machine learning techniques (i.e., linear SVM, polynomial SVM, and ANN) widely adopted for binary classification problems to predicts drivers’ stop-or-go decision.|partc 2021|

|Pedestrian intention prediction: A convolutional bottom-up multi-task approach |We want to predict the pedestrians’ intention to cross the road as early as possible given a single image. We present a new neural network for the primary task of pedestrian intention prediction. Our model takes as input only a single RGB image and generates a map predicting the probability that each pixel constitutes a pedestrian who is either crossing or not, bypassing the need for a people detector and running at constant time. We additionally have our model output in parallel, the detailed human body pose for 
each pedestrian (Fig. 1c) c) to show that our network can be easily extended to perform a variety of other tasks with little overhead. The byproduct of the intention or pose map also allows the model to function as a generic people detector.|partc 2021|

|Connected automated vehicle control in single lane roundabouts|To optimize the trajectory of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) in roundabouts, we formulate an trajectory optimization problem that includes vehicle dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. The objective function of the problem minimizes the distance of CAVs to their destinations and their acceleration magnitudes. The methodology also involves a customized solution technique that convexifies the collision-avoidance constraints and decompose the convexified problem into two sub-problems. The first sub-problem only includes vehicle dynamics constraints while the second sub-problem projects the solutions of the first sub-problem onto a collision-free region. These sub-problem is then transformed into a quadratic problem to get the optimal solution by redefining its decision variables along vehicle paths. |partc 2021|

A bi-level optimization model is formulated based on discrete time to optimize both the longitudinal and lateral trajectories of a single CAV given signal timings and the trajectory information of surrounding vehicles. The upper-level model optimizes lateral lane-changing strategies. The lowerlevel model optimizes longitudinal acceleration profiles based on the lane-changing strategies from the upper-level model. A Lane-Changing Strategy Tree (LCST) and a Parallel Monte-Carlo Tree Search (PMCTS) algorithm are designed to solve the bi-level optimization model.|partc 2021|

|Data-driven road side unit location optimization for connected-autonomous-vehicle-based intersection control| To achieve low vehicle-to-road-side-unit (V2R) communication delay and support the implementation of CAV-based intersection control strategies, this study addresses the problem of road side unit (RSU) location optimization at a single intersection. The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear program. The model aims to minimize the sum of the cost associated with RSU investment and the expectation of the penalty cost associated with V2R communication delay exceeding a pre-determined threshold. The first stage of the program determines the number and location of RSUs, when the intersection control strategy to be implemented is unknown. Given the first stage decision and the implemented intersection control strategy, the second stage model optimizes the detection area allocation among RSUs to minimize the penalty cost.|partc 2021|
