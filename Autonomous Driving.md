|A deep learning framework for modelling left-turning vehicle behaviour considering diagonal-crossing motorcycle conflicts at mixed-flow intersections|To model vehicle turning behaviour, we present a novel interaction-aware deep-learning framework. Firstly, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based network is employed to encode vehicle historical motion features. Then, each vehicle’s potential target lanes are identified with a probabilistic method, followed by a pooling module that extracts and summarizes intention features. Thirdly, Graph Attention Network (GAT) and a synthesized network are introduced to model vehicle-vehicle interaction and vehicle-motorcycle interaction respectively. Finally, multiple kinds of obtained features are sent to a LSTM based decoder module to generate future displacement and body orientation.|partc 2021|
|A Bayesian inference based adaptive lane change prediction model|This paper aims to build a lane change prediction model for surrounding vehiclesl to adapt to the change of road and traffic environment based on machine learning methods. The lane change prediction model contains a basic model and an adaptive model: the basic model is a long short-term memory (LSTM) based prediction model which reflects the decision-making mode for drivers; the adaptive prediction model embeds an adaptive decision threshold on the basic model, and the threshold updates by Bayesian Inference method on time.|partc 2021|

Furthermore, we also propose a sampling technique to keep the temporal information and consider the interaction among agents through concatenating their trajectories when constructing features. | partc 2021 |

|Connected automated vehicle control in single lane roundabouts |To optimize the trajectory of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) in roundabouts, we formulate an trajectory optimization problem that includes vehicle dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. The objective function of the problem minimizes the distance of CAVs to their destinations and their acceleration magnitudes. The methodology also involves a customized solution technique that convexifies the collision-avoidance constraints and decompose the convexified problem into two sub-problems. The first sub-problem only includes vehicle dynamics constraints while the second sub-problem projects the solutions of the first sub-problem onto a collision-free region. These sub-problem is then transformed into a quadratic problem to get the optimal solution by redefining its decision variables along vehicle paths. |partc 2021|

Our purpose here is to address this dynamic version of the problem that falls in the class of Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problems (DVRPs) where new inputs are received while the current planned routes are executed. We propose a methodology that reacts to modifications to travel times by maintaining as much as possible the current planned routes, but without compromising too much solution quality.|partc 2021|

|Ramp metering control under stochastic capacity in a connected environment: A dynamic bargaining game theory approach|This paper presents a dynamic predictive and cooperative ramp metering approach to solve stochastic breakdowns at merging bottlenecks. A stochastic microscopic model is used to estimate traffic state parameters based on speed, location, and travel time information from connected vehicles. Traffic state predictions are obtained on a lane by lane basis using an adaptive Kalman filter (AKF); the AKF then produces multiple step ahead predictions. The ramp metering problem in this paper is modeled as a stochastic distributed model predictive control (SDMPC) approach. The SDMPC problem is solved based on a bargaining game approach where each controller, a player in the game, receives traffic state and control decision information from other controllers to solve the local optimization problem based on expected local costs and constraints. |partc 2021|
